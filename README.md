#  Introduction
The GenAI Career Recommender System is designed to leverage enterprise-level resources and blend them with employees' current domain, experience level, and technologies to recommend personalized career paths. This documentation provides an in-depth overview of the system's architecture, functionalities, and implementation details.

# Problem Statement
The system aims to solve the challenge of recommending personalized career paths, identifying skill gaps, and suggesting efficient skill-building resources within Dell. The key deliverables include career option recommendations, secure execution, gap identification, and a recommendation system for upskilling resources.

# Deliverables
- Career option recommendations based on employee information.
- Smooth and secure execution as an internal tool of Dell.
- Identification of career gaps and skill gaps.
- Recommendation system for upskilling resources.

# Initial Solution Ideation

## Processing

### a. Input Data and Preprocessing

#### Employee Information:
- Collect parameterized employee information, including current domain, level of experience, skillset, and technologies used.
- Preprocess the input data to convert it into feature vectors suitable for NLP processing.

### b. NLP Processing

#### Feature Extraction:
- Utilize basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from the preprocessed text data.
- Convert textual data into numerical vectors that can be used as input for the recommender system.

#### Algorithmic Processing:
- Implement algorithms that analyze the feature vectors to understand the employee's current state and potential career paths.
- Use machine learning models or rule-based systems to identify patterns and correlations in the data.

#### Career Vertical Recommendations:
- Develop a recommender system that suggests the top three viable career verticals based on the processed employee information.
- The recommendations should consider factors such as the employee's current domain, experience level, skillset, and relevant technologies.

### c. Skill Gap Identification

#### Compare Skills:
- Analyze the skills required in the recommended career verticals against the employee's existing skillset.
- Identify gaps by highlighting the skills that the employee needs to acquire or enhance for a successful transition.

#### Development Plan:
- Generate a personalized development plan outlining the steps the employee can take to bridge the identified skill gaps.
- Prioritize skill development activities based on urgency and relevance to the chosen career paths.

### d. Output Generation

#### Career Path Recommendations:
- Provide clear and concise career path recommendations, including detailed information on each suggested vertical.
- Include insights into potential job roles, responsibilities, and growth opportunities.

#### Skill Gap Report:
- Generate a comprehensive report highlighting the identified skill gaps and recommended actions for skill development.

### e. Integration with Enterprise Resources

#### Access Enterprise Data:
- Integrate the system with enterprise-level resources to access relevant data about internal job opportunities, training programs, and skill requirements.

#### Enterprise Compatibility:
- Ensure seamless integration with Dell's internal systems and databases, allowing for real-time updates on job openings and skill requirements.

##  Presentation and Interaction

### a. REST API

#### Endpoints:
- Define REST API endpoints for receiving employee information, processing requests, and delivering recommendations.
- Document the API with clear descriptions of each endpoint, expected parameters, and response formats.

#### Scalability:
- Design the API to be scalable, allowing for future enhancements and accommodating a growing user base.

### b. User-Friendly Web Interface

#### Dashboard:
- Create an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard for users to interact with the system.
- Include sections for inputting data, viewing recommendations, and accessing skill development resources.

#### Responsive Design:
- Ensure the web interface is responsive and accessible across various devices to enhance user experience.

#### Feedback Mechanism:
- Implement a feedback mechanism to gather user responses, ensuring continuous improvement of the system.

## Security Measures

### a. Authentication

#### User Authentication:
- Implement secure user authentication methods to control access to the system.
- Consider multi-factor authentication for an added layer of security.

#### Data Encryption:
- Encrypt sensitive data during transmission and storage to protect employee information.

#### Authorization Controls:
- Define and enforce access controls to restrict users' actions based on their roles and permissions.

##  Database Management

### a. MongoDB Integration

#### Schema Design:
- Design a MongoDB schema that efficiently stores employee data while ensuring data integrity.

#### Data Privacy:
- Implement measures to protect the privacy of employee data, adhering to data protection regulations.

#### Backup and Recovery:
- Establish regular backup and recovery procedures to prevent data loss and ensure system reliability.
